### UI Improvements:
In Milestone 3, we had a home page and separated the functional page into two 
equal halves, with the left side functioning as the “location menu” and right 
side containing information about the location selected by the user. We built 
on this by adding a faded background image and borders to clearly highlight 
the separation between the location menu and the information that will be shown 
to the user. From this, we added tabs separating the trail information and 
gallery. The user knows that they can access both pieces of information easily, 
but has to concentrate on only one at a time. The trails are contained in a 
selector box, with blank spots for trail data to fill. The gallery is 
constrained in a fixed box so that pictures do not push the screen down 
to infinity. 

We also added more map functionality. When an user clicks on one of the map 
markers, the map will load the relevant information on the right and zoom 
in to the marker so that the user can more clearly see what is around the area. 

### User Privacy
Because of the concerns raised at the beginning of this class, we focused on 
the theme of “discovery and recommendations”. Our app does not collect any 
user data, but instead encourages users to explore the trails and scenery 
of California’s national parks. We used publicly available data by the 
National Park Service, but left it up to the user to interact with the data 
in a way that is meaningful to them.
