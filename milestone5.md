### UI Description

We improved the responsiveness and communication of our UI by adding signifying animations so the user knows that the screen has changed, as well as making our code more efficient with better loops and resizing images (less data to load). We also changed the background to a cleaner topographic pattern so the user is less distracted by it, as well as evoking the notion of geography. We changed our gallery to a carousel view so that users can view images of parks with better resolution and minimized our logo so that there is more space to view the relevant information. The map is fixed on California so the user is not distracted by irrelevant areas.

### User Action 1 

The user can mouseover circles on the map on the left side of our app to view available locations. The color of the circle denotes whether the location is popular or not. They can then click on a circle to zoom in and view the selected locationâ€™s data on the right side. This can also be accomplished by clicking the green buttons on the left bottom corner.

### User Action 2

After selecting a location of their choice, the user can see and parse through relevant information about their choice on the right hand side of the app, such as trail data, images, and weather information. They can also visit the place on Google Maps with the short link at the end of every introduction.
