### App Description
Point Poppy is a web-based application that gives information about the national parks in California. Currently, people need to create separate Google searches for finding a park to visit, as well as separate searches for information about that park. Our app aggregates searching, exploring, and learning features when people want to visit a California national park. We provide an interactive map with locations of parks and respective park and trail descriptions, trailhead locations, images, weather information, and link for directions in a way that is intuitive to the user and encourages exploring California's beautiful national parks!

### Source Code Files
#### server.js
This is the main Node.js file that utilizes the Express and Unirest frameworks to get and serve data to the user.

#### backendjs/parkCoords.js
This uses the National Park Serviceâ€™s API to generate coordinates of parks that we select. This information is used for various map functions (e.g. circles, trail markers, etc.) and to generate corresponding links to Google Maps.

#### static/index2.html
This is the main HTML file utilizing Bootstrap and containing the structure and elements of Point Poppy, including its buttons, map, and textboxes.

#### static/styles/styles.css
This is the main stylesheet for Point Poppy. It holds all the stylings that make Point Poppy unique and a joy to use, such as the colors, fonts, and spacing.

#### static/scripts/leaflet.js
This is the Javascript file that controls user interactions with the map. It generates circles based on coordinates and allows the user to zoom in on an area or show where a selected trailhead is, as well as filling in the corresponding information for each location (e.g. trails, weather, image gallery, etc.) when necessary.

#### static/scripts/pointPoppy.js
This is the Javascript file that controls all user interactions (excluding the map). It generates corresponding information for each location (e.g. trails, weather, image gallery, etc.) when necessary.
