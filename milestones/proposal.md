## Project Proposal
===
Our project focuses on aggregating civic information into an interactive map.
This map is intended for new immigrants deciding on an area to live in San
Diego or California (depending on our data). We would get our data from the 
Google Civic and U.S. Census APIs, and aim to look at factors such as median
income, crime rates, unemployment rates, and spoken language use (city 
fluency in languages like Spanish and Chinese). 

## Other Ideas:
**Political Information Hub**
* Simple but can be fleshed out more. Interactive map using the Google Civic 
Data API with representative information and historical voting record. 
**Recipe Recommendations** 
* Generates recipe recommendations based on sales and coupons from local 
supermarkets. Recipe matching would be pulled from recipe sites such as 
Epicurious or AllRecipes.
**Music Recommendations**
* Based on tags like “road trip” or “calm” or “breakup”, you can discover 
music, and have friends (or anyone that you share the random url with) make 
a playlist for you. There could also be options to automatically generate 
playlists based on your friends’ Recently Listened To songs or combine your 
own Most Listened songs to with those of your friends in a shared playlist. 
Users could also generate recommendations based on producer, not the artist, 
since producers may be closer to what users want to listen to in some cases.
* Location-based music recommender: finds local artists of the city/county you 
are in and generates an ongoing playlist/queue for you. Good for road trips or 
supporting local artists.
