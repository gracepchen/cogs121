**Comparison to Prototypes**

Our skeleton shares many similarities with our paper prototypes. The overall
map interface has a similar design to the prototypes, with the map screen
taking up a major portion of the screen real estate. However, rather than a
small popup displaying points of interest, we decided to instead allocate half
of the screen to displaying the park's information, in order to make it easier
for users to view the details for a certain park. The park information has also
been split vertically, in order to more directly display the information to
users. We decided to incorperate some aspects of prototype 2 with the prototype
1 design, such as a small descriptive blurb for each park, with a small image.
