### UI Description
Visually, we colored the containers and changed the font to fit with the theme of the app. We also improved on how the page loads, delaying and animating to display bits of information at a time to avoid the previous clunky loading.

### Data Visualization Description
We used Leaflet as our main data Visualization. Since our app centers around the state of California, we start with a zoomed in California state map on the landing page. The users have free reign to zoom in and out as they please. Each circle on the map represents a national park. When selected, the map zooms in on the  park and the according park information displays on the right hand side of the screen.
