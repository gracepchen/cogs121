## Project Proposal
===
Our project focuses on aggregating civic information into an interactive map. This map is intended for new immigrants deciding on an area to live in San Diego or California (depending on our data). We would get our data from the Google Civic and U.S. Census APIs, and aim to look at factors such as median income, crime rates, unemployment rates, and spoken language use (city fluency in languages like Spanish and Chinese).

## Other Ideas:
* Recipe Recommendations:
Recipe recommendations based on sales and coupons from local supermarkets. Recipe matching pulled from recipe sites such as Epicurious or AllRecipes.
